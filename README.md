# Global-Labor-Market-Study
An ongoing financial data and economics research project looking at historic and present labor market trends, identifying causality, and exploring strategy and policy.

Only the first of three parts of this project is made for public use at the moment in a limited capacity.

This repository is an excerpt of Q2 and Q3 market data from 2022. Median salaries were collected across cities around the world and across professions for early and mid-career compensation.

Living expenses were deducted based off of the lifestyle of a representative sample, adjusted for local living costs. Further adjustments were made deducting income tax. For comparison all salaries are converted to USD.

Feel free to [contact](https://github.com/robme-l/robme-l) me at [robme.l@tuta.io](mailto:robme.l@tuta.io).

### Measure of Opportunity
